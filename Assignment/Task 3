--1 Write an SQL query to calculate the total payments made by a specific student. You will need to join the "Payments" table
--with the "Students" table based on the student's ID.

/*SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_payments
FROM Payments
WHERE student_id = 1;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--2 Write an SQL query to retrieve a list of courses along with the count of students enrolled in eachcourse.
--Use a JOIN operation between the "Courses" table and the "Enrollments" table.

/*SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS student_count
FROM Courses c
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--3 Write an SQL query to find the names of students who have not enrolled in any course. 
--Use aLEFT JOIN between the "Students" table and the "Enrollments" table to identify students  without enrollments.

/*SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
WHERE e.student_id IS NULL;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--4 Write an SQL query to retrieve the first name, last name of students, and the names of the courses they are enrolled in. 
--Use JOIN operations between the "Students" table and the "Enrollments" and "Courses" tables.

/*SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--5 Create a query to list the names of teachers and the courses they are assigned to. Join the "Teacher" table with the "Courses" table.

/*SELECT t.first_name, t.last_name, c.course_name
FROM Teacher t
JOIN Courses c ON t.teacher_id = c.teacher_id;*/


/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--6 Retrieve a list of students and their enrollment dates for a specific course. You'll need to join the "Students" table with the "Enrollments" and "Courses" tables.

/*SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, e.enrollment_date
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
WHERE e.course_id = 1; */

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--7 Find the names of students who have not made any payments. Use a LEFT JOIN between the "Students" table and the "Payments" 
--table and filter for students with NULL payment records.

/*SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Payments p ON s.student_id = p.student_id
WHERE p.student_id IS NULL;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


--8 Write a query to identify courses that have no enrollments.
--You'll need to use a LEFT JOIN between the "Courses" table and the "Enrollments" table and filter for courses with NULL enrollment records.

/*SELECT c.course_name
FROM Courses c
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
WHERE e.course_id IS NULL;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


--9 Identify students who are enrolled in more than one course. Use a self-join on the "Enrollments" table to 
--find students with multiple enrollment records.

/*SELECT e.student_id
FROM Enrollments e
GROUP BY e.student_id
HAVING COUNT(e.course_id) > 1;*/

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

--10 . Find teachers who are not assigned to any courses. Use a LEFT JOIN between the "Teacher" table and the "Courses" table 
--and filter for teachers with NULL course assignments.

/*SELECT t.first_name, t.last_name
FROM Teacher t
LEFT JOIN Courses c ON t.teacher_id = c.teacher_id
WHERE c.teacher_id IS NULL;*/
